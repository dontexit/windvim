# windvim
Neovim config

Just my neovim config lol.

note to self: 
Package managers make use of vim.fn.stdpath("data") to attach themselves to nvim and it could be different on different environments. 
To check where it is located for your environment, do:
`vim.print(vim.fn.stdpath("data"))` 

Hopfully it wont take forever next time to debug any plugin manager issues and I dont have to bang myself in the head cluelessly looking for the casue of the issue.
